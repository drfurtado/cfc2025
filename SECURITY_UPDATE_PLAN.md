# Security Update Plan

## Identified Vulnerabilities

From the npm audit report, we have identified the following vulnerabilities:

1. **High Severity**: `nth-check <2.0.1` - Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
   - Affects: SVGO package used in the build process

2. **Moderate Severity**: `postcss <8.4.31` - Line return parsing error
   - Affects: resolve-url-loader

## Update Strategy

Instead of using `npm audit fix --force`, which could introduce breaking changes by downgrading to react-scripts@3.0.1, we'll take a more targeted approach:

1. **First attempt**: Update react-scripts to the latest version that's compatible with our React version
2. **Second attempt**: Selectively update the vulnerable packages while keeping react-scripts at its current version
3. **Third attempt**: If all else fails, pin the versions but document the vulnerabilities as accepted risks

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Update React and React-Scripts

```bash
npm install --save react@latest react-dom@latest react-scripts@latest
```

### Step 2: Selective Package Updates

If Step 1 causes issues, we can try to update just the vulnerable dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save nth-check@latest postcss@latest
```

### Step 3: Override Strategy

If direct updates don't work, we can use npm's overrides feature to force the use of non-vulnerable versions:

Add to package.json:
```json
"overrides": {
  "nth-check": "^2.0.1",
  "postcss": "^8.4.31"
}
```

Then run:
```bash
npm install
```

## Testing Procedure

After each update attempt:

1. Start the development server: `npm start`
2. Verify that all pages load correctly
3. Check that all functionality works as expected
4. Verify that the build process still works: `npm run build`

## Rollback Procedure

If updates cause significant issues:

1. Revert to the previous package.json and package-lock.json
2. Document the vulnerabilities in this file
3. Add security considerations to the code comments where applicable
4. Plan for a more comprehensive update in the future

## Timeline

This update should be performed in a separate branch and thoroughly tested before merging to main.

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk**: Breaking changes in component rendering
  - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing across different browsers and devices
  
- **Risk**: Build process failures
  - **Mitigation**: Keep original package-lock.json backup and prepared rollback process

- **Risk**: New vulnerabilities introduced by updates
  - **Mitigation**: Run npm audit after each update
